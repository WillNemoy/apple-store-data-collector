First of all, the app is addicting. I‚Äôve lost so many hours watching TikTok that I could‚Äôve been studying, sleeping, etcetera. I know it‚Äôs partially my fault, but I still think more can be done to prevent users from staying on the app for long periods of time. The second thing is about updates. I have multiple TikTok accounts. Every account has a different version of updates. I am also always behind on new updates because of this. When I go on the app store most of the time it reads ‚Äúopen‚Äù instead of ‚Äúupdate‚Äù. I‚Äôm very frustrated when I can‚Äôt participate in trends because I‚Äôm still stuck with a version that is 2 months behind all of my friends. I understand the app isn‚Äôt perfect but if there‚Äôs an update it should be available to all users at the same time. I know that my phone isn‚Äôt the problem, as other users have experienced the same thing as me. Other than this and the fact that I can‚Äôt stay off of it, TikTok is a great app and sometimes can be very uplifting and kind. The app allows you to express your creativity and learn to do things you would‚Äôve never thought you would need to know. I believe if these two things could be improved, then TikTok will be the perfect app for people to use as a way to get involved and be their true selves.', 'attributes': {'type': 'text'}}","{'attributes': {'rel': 'related', 'href': 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software'}}",{'label': '84'},"{'attributes': {'term': 'Application', 'label': 'Application'}}",{'label': '161'}

It can create unique spaces of community on the app, and provide content for people to talk about, share, and bond over outside the app itself. However, from my own experience, I would rate the app a 3 out of 5. The fact that the For You page provides a constant stream of new content is a brilliant design choice to get people to spend longer on the app, it can often feel like the user does not have agency over what they are seeing. Additionally, fears about being on a different ‚Äòside‚Äô of TikTok than peers could be a source of stress or concern for some adolescents, adding to potential mental health effects social media can have. Most of the design of the app is intuitive once the user has been on it for a little bit, and while the privacy settings are not front-and-center, they are available so that adolescents can have the content that they view tailored somewhat to not include inappropriate content and to promote healthy app usage, but allowing a parent to have potential control over being able to extend time using the app must feel like an invasion of their privacy. However, without an external source of monitoring, it can be very easy for adolescents, as well as adults, to become compulsive TikTok users who only find sporadic joy from the content they watch.', 'attributes': {'type': 'text'}}","{'attributes': {'rel': 'related', 'href': 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software'}}",{'label': '288'},"{'attributes': {'term': 'Application', 'label': 'Application'}}",{'label': '544'}

My biggest complaint though is how broken the moderation system is. It‚Äôs unusually strict and even unpredictable. Even when I follow guidelines I still get content taken down, which is confusing and frustrating. On other platforms such as Twitter, Insta, etc., I have never gotten any of my content taken down or flagged ever. I‚Äôve had several TikToks taken down for unknown reasons and the reasons listed are usually vague or wildly incorrect. For example, I used a fake animal prop and it was taken down for ‚Äúviolence‚Äù even though I made a disclaimer in the video stating it was a prop and no actual animals were harmed. Despite this, my appeal got rejected so I emailed customer service, which itself is a whole other headache to deal with. It took them WEEKS to respond and all they did was give me a generic response to click the appeal link, which I already told them that I did. It‚Äôs as if they didn‚Äôt read the actual email at all.

Overall the app has potential but the racism on the platform and content that is dangerous to minors means that users need to be monitored by parents or guardians if they are not adults. Hopefully there will be a similar app with a much better algorithm that will surface in the near future and replace this one making TikTok obsolete.', 'attributes': {'type': 'text'}}","{'attributes': {'rel': 'related', 'href': 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software'}}",{'label': '1'},"{'attributes': {'term': 'Application', 'label': 'Application'}}",{'label': '1'}

I‚Äôm not trying to act like a pick me but I assume you should wear glasses. I give Roblox 4 stars because of all of the issues. Another issue that probably all the robloxians hate is when Roblox will randomly have an issue, unexpectedly. You can be playing something and it will kick u out and u have to sign back into your account. This needs to be fixed. The good thing about Roblox is that it is very fun , and u can have a blast on this app. I really like Roblox but not the issues. Roblox is a very nice app and me and my friends will be on it a couple hours of the day, whenever we are bored. I also like that there are a ton of mini games to choose from. Games like royale high , adopt me , Bloxburg , put a finger down , the mimic , and ALOT more.

I and your audience would be very happy if you would allow us to write in the ""comments"" section a little more text. I understand that part of the small text size is probably due to the fact that someone might start spamming comments with more characters. But understand - no one needs it now. Seriously.

And worse than that they don‚Äôt always review stuff and when they do it‚Äôs just personal opinion on their part if they like it or not. Also they will suppress content creators like cosplayers or just ban their accounts all together for no reason. They also claim to have rules and stuff against bullying and harassment yet instead when someone comes to them about being bullied or harassed TikTok will punish the person being bullied by suppressing their account and making it so their videos don‚Äôt get seen as much rather than dealing with the actual bully, and they also will do this same suppression and content hiding on people who they don‚Äôt find attractive, people with disabilities, and people who they think are overweight.

Definitely has potential to be a great marketing tool EXCEPT for the fact that it upholds a racist infrastructure. White content creators often are allowed to be blatantly racist and spew *actual* racist propaganda and slurs while Black, Indigenous and other POC communities have to walk on egg shells just to keep their accounts from being flagged or banned. Also, the apps algorithm allows white creators to flourish while actively suppressing Black creators‚Äô content. This creates a disparity when it comes to money to be made because more often Black CCs set the most popular trends and receive little to no recognition from the app or other non-Black, specifically white CCs‚Äîespecially after the trend/sound has become viral. There is also the apps (those who work for/regulate) involvement in the conspiracy to suppress historical and currently relevant information. It does a great job at censorship. If it were not for the app taking constant punitive measures against anything Black and POC CCs make that doesnt directly uplift & support white supremacy and comfort, then this would be a cool place to be. Right now, theres a Black woman follow train trend happening. Not only are we seeing the vitriol from angry white women who are offended they werent centered in a Black space (shocker), we are also experiencing delays and outright deletion when requesting or accepting our Sisters.

If your child is 11+ I would say they will be fine. The app itself is organized very well, so you save videos and sounds to look at later. You are allowed to have a private or public account depending where n your comfort. A private account means that you have to send a request to follow the user. This also means that you have to follow the user in order to watch their videos. Having a public account means anybody can follow you and anybody can sit and scroll through your account. You can remove followers. When having a public account, your videos may also be on the for you page. The for you page is videos you can scroll through of content that is recommended for you based on what you like and save. This is how many videos go viral.

TikTok is a great place for socializing. Better than other apps, TikTok asks what you like then shows it on your fyp, you can also customize what creators and specific content is on your fyp by liking videos and following creators.  There are fun trends to follow, with cool filters as well! You can have 8 accounts in total and they won‚Äôt be connected to the others, (so if you want a secret account, no one will find you). You can favorite sounds and videos, comments, etc.    That was Tiktoks good features!      Now for the not so great ones. These are the reason TikTok got a 4/5 from me.        So, TikTok has something called community guidelines, to keep every young child on the app safe and just cyber bullying under control in general, but the thing is, these guidelines are commonly false. For example, I got banned on a account with over 1000 followers for bullying even though I was duetting myself saying I was improving. And dumb things get removed on TikTok, such as videos, accounts, and comments. But then there are some cases where someone is doing something so wrong and it doesn‚Äôt even get removed until it gets over 1000 reports. That‚Äôs messed up. Other than that, tiktok is a great place! I recommend it! Just watch out for those guidelines! üò¨üëç', 'attributes': {'type': 'text'}}","{'attributes': {'rel': 'related', 'href': 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software'}}",{'label': '6'},"{'attributes': {'term': 'Application', 'label': 'Application'}}",{'label': '11'}
