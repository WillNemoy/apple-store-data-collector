(Music platforms I’ve used premium for: SoundCloud, Apple Music) Out of all of the platforms I’ve used, this one trumps all of them by having the greatest variety of songs. Literally all of my music is on here, including covers, nightcore, pop, rock, indie, alternative, rap, and foreign genres like kpop and jpop. It also has the lyrics automatically displayed and as someone who likes to sing and sometimes read for better lyrics comprehension, this is a great feature to have! Of course I have premium but I’ve used the free version for a considerable amount of time, and I can say that it’s definitely worth it to get premium for no ads, unlimited skips, and infinite playlist customization. I love listening to playlists I’ve created on this app! I have over 20 of them so far. This feature is awesome; you can share playlists with friends (and even collaborate with them on playlists too!), put a custom cover image, add a description, and add whatever songs you want. I like this feature because then I don’t have to manually change songs every time one ends. The fact that you can download songs is great too, and this app works on very low bandwidth so if you’re on a plane that offers wifi you can listen without having to worry. Overall I’d say if you’re considering going premium, this app is a must have! But if you want the free version, just know you’ll have limited control over what you play and when you play it.', 'attributes': {'type': 'text'}}","{'attributes': {'rel': 'related', 'href': 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software'}}",{'label': '244'},"{'attributes': {'term': 'Application', 'label': 'Application'}}",{'label': '380'}

I love this app a lot because of its playlist ability but I do not like the new update. In the update they changed how playlists work and how the artist areas and songs are played. My main problem with the new update is the fact that you can’t play the songs you have inside a playlist you can only play the playlist and it will shuffle through the songs you have in that playlist. Most of the time when I use a playlist I categorize songs that make me feel a certain way so when I’m feeling that emotion I can go into that playlist and listen to the song I want; however with the new update I can’t pick which song I start with and it really annoys me. I also hate all the new options and how much guess work has to happen. I much prefer the old set up and navigation to the new one and would like there to be some kind of settings option to go back to the old version or to just scrap this dumpster fire of a new set up all together.\n\nTo any readers of this I’m sorry if a lot of what I said was repeated or doesn’t make sense I’m not the best at expressing how I feel about something through words I just really needed to talk about how much I hate this update.', 'attributes': {'type': 'text'}}","{'attributes': {'rel': 'related', 'href': 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software'}}",{'label': '0'},"{'attributes': {'term': 'Application', 'label': 'Application'}}",{'label': '0'}

I only have two complaints. \nOne is that in the playlists that the app creates for you, it tends to only play songs that you have already listened to multiple times (in shuffle lol) or popular, similar ones. If I follow an artist, there should be an option to mix their more obscure music with the popular stuff. If a playlist is ""made for me,"" it should be able to play whatever it is I like, whether it\'s a superstar\'s most popular hit songs, or the most obscure songs released by a guy with 500 listeners. It\'s not a radio station; it only has to cater to the tastes of one specific person.\nSecondly, there should be a way to add, if not entire artists, then at least full albums to playlists that you\'re creating from the app. I follow over fifty artists, and if I like all of their music, I don\'t want to add all 3000+ of their songs individually. It wouldn\'t be a hard feature to add, and would make me actually likely to create a playlist or two.\nThank you for reading my review!', 'attributes': {'type': 'text'}}","{'attributes': {'rel': 'related', 'href': 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software'}}",{'label': '5'},"{'attributes': {'term': 'Application', 'label': 'Application'}}",{'label': '6'}

I don’t listen to a certain playlist I listen to my saved songs but now since the update songs that Iv had “saved” or “liked” before show that they have not been like either when you swipe left or actually go on the song and click the green heart. But it still shows up in my “liked music”. This makes me incredibly confused because I’m unsure if I actually have the song saved or not. Also there is no bar on the side of the screen that shows the letters in which you can find the song alphabetically which there was earlier when “liked songs” was “saved songs” this makes it difficult to find certain songs, because I can’t just go down to the letter anymore. Also with the shuffle on my “liked songs”, if my filter is on to sort by title and I click “shuffle play” usually the same four songs play.  I really thing the shuffling algorithm needs to be fixed because I’m not enjoying the other songs I want to listen on my “liked songs”. Moral of this is that this new update didn’t fix anything about the app but made it harder to use now that “liked songs” is treated as a regular play list and not songs that I have saved.', 'attributes': {'type': 'text'}}","{'attributes': {'rel': 'related', 'href': 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software'}}",{'label': '25'},"{'attributes': {'term': 'Application', 'label': 'Application'}}",{'label': '28'}
